 Note from Sam Golob:

 This sequence of emails is a sort of history to tell you
 what's going on here.

 This IEFACTRT exit provides A LOT of information that most
 IEFACTRT exits do not provide.  The original reason for
 making this exit public, was the hope that someone will go
 on maintaining it, and will return their modified source
 code back to PEMCO, so PEMCO would still be able to use it.

 Of course, whoever uses this code would THEMSELVES benefit
 greatly from its use.

 So here it is a synopsis of my conversation with Dale:

    Sam,

    I'm an old sysprog, 45 years in the business (35 doing
    contract work) - remembering the CBT tape as an actual tape
    (round, I think).  I've found it useful on occasion in the
    past.  Thanks to you and SamK for your efforts to
    maintain it.

    I've been maintaining our IEFACTRT exit forever - as pretty
    much the only assembler guy in-house.  I've been tasked
    with trying to make that exit more maintainable going forward
    with non-assembler staff.  My options seem to be to:

    Find IEFACTRT source that will be maintained out-of-house
    going forward - perhaps on the CBT tape? Rewrite the exit in
    a HLL - if that's even possible - to be maintained in-house.
    I don't actually see an assembler requirement in the IBM doc
    though it seems likely.  One possibility is system REXX
    though I also don't find doc on if that's possible either.

    Our existing exit includes some stats that we find useful
    including zIIP and zEDC usage.   We'd hate to lose that info.

    Have you any suggestions on possible solutions to my needs?

    Thanks, Dale

    Dear Dale,

    I'd have to see a copy of your exit, and what the output looks like.
    Maybe if we keep it on the CBT tape as "something standard", and if
    it is not specific to your company, then we could have outside help
    in maintaining it, because other people are using it.  Sound like
    a plan?

    All the best of everything to you and your family.

    Sincerely,    Sam

 Sam,

 I'm attaching some sample output from our routine.  See the
 PFSTRTxx messages as well as the flower boxes.  I'm checking
 with management to see if providing the routine will be a
 problem.  I'll give you a call when that is known. If Q or
 comments, please call me.

 Thanks, Dale

 Sam,

 Sorry for not responding to your calls last week but I've had
 nothing to report.  I'm still pursuing getting management
 approval on providing the exit and your VMs prompted me to
 re-issue that request.  Hopefully some word this week - I'll
 let you know if that happens.

 Regards, Dale

 Sam,

 An XMIT version of a lib is attached containing the source and
 local assembly proc ASMACL.   A couple things to note:

     The exit makes use of the TCBUSER field to save the address
     of a local control block, PFSACTRT, to save some accumulated
     job stats.   Before installation, a shop should verify that
     field is not already in use in their shop.

     As noted in the comments, the exit makes use of BAKR and PR
     instructions to save/restore regs.

     As noted in the comments, the exit makes use of 4-byte
     service unit fields like SMF30CSU rather than more current
     8-byte fields like SMF30CSU_L.

 I checked with the original author of this code, Scott Pearson,
 who's still working as a systems programmer, though nearing
 retirement.  I hired him as a junior sysprog somewhere around
 1986 :>).  He was OK leaving his name on it.   My name isn't
 actually on it though there's a lot of DAT updates.   Feel free
 to provide it, or not.

 Let me know if Q.

 Take care and stay healthy.   Dale
